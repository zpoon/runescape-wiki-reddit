# runescape-wiki-reddit
A simple reddit bot that links relevant RuneScape wiki page to comments. Supports contextual replies in /r/runescape and /r/2007scape.

Enclose search terms in two square brackets `[[ ]]` in a comment for the bot to find a relevant Wiki article, grab a quick summary, and link it in a reply.

Syntax: `[[search_item]]`

I currently run /u/RSWikiLink on my own hardware. I'm more than happy to continue this, but if you found it helpful and want to help with the small costs involved, then feel free to chip in :)
